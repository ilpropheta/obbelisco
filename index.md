# Obbelisco

**Obbelisco** (roman malapropism of the word "obelisco" that means "obelisk" in English) is a car game developed by Marco Arena and a friend of him (who wants to stay anonymous) with [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). The game is inspired by the italian movie [*Velocit√† Massima*](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocit%C3%A0_massima_(film)).

The game is set in Rome and specifically in the heart of [EUR](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(Roma)), around *Marconi's Obelisk* in *piazza Marconi*. The neighborhood has been very roughly reconstructed with Blender, Google Maps, Google Images, and perseverance.

## Game features

-  the player can drive everywhere in the area, including some secret places like *EUR Palasport* underground entrance, and some buildings
-  *missions*: some of the key moments in the movie have been made playable as:
  - *objects collection*: the player has to find and pick up some objects (the map gives some hints)
  - *race against time*: the player has to complete a race lap within a certain time
  - *race against opponent*: the player has to complete a race lap against an opponent
- after completing the first mission, the player can go back and forth to the workshop in *Ostia* and change some car settings (the workshop incluses a track to test those changes)
- save and load of the game (everytime but during missions)
- teleportation
